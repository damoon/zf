Zend Framework Preview
----------------------

Thanks for downloading the preview.  The files in this archive are
released under the Zend Framework license.  Please see LICENSE.txt
in this directory for a copy of the license.

Please note that the preview is not a single release.  Check
http://framework.zend.com often for updates.  A new preview will
be built as needed when improvements and bugfixes are made.

Documentation can be found in the /documentation directory:

/documentation
    /api
    /end-user

The API docs are automatically generated by phpDocumentor and the
end-user docs are generated from Docbook sources.  Please note that
this documentation is not complete.  We are very actively working to
improve the documentation and consider this a high priority.  All
documentation is in HTML and can be viewed with your web browser.

Zend Framework classes can be found in these directories:

/lib
/incubator

The /lib contains files that are mostly working but no files in
this distribution should be considered stable and they are subject to
change at any time.  However, you should have reasonable success using
the files in this directory.  If you experience problems, and we expect
you will at this early stage, please check the TODO files and then submit
a report to our bug tracker at http://framework.zend.com/bugs/.

The /incubator directory contains recent contributions that may eventually
be moved to the /lib directory.  These are considered highly unstable.
Feel free to check them out but please don't submit bugs for these to
the tracker at this time.

No special installation is required, however the Framework classes
expect that the /lib directory is in your include_path.  You will also
find a /demos directory with some code samples to run.
