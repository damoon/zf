The coding standard is based upon Codesniffer.

To test the coding standard you must have the latest
release of PHP_CodeSniffer installed. You can get it
from PEAR.

Copy the directory "Zend" to your "standards"
directory of CodeSniffer.

Change the standard to use by CodeSniffer:
phpcs --config-set default_standard Zend

Change the tab usage to zero to check for tabs:
phpcs --config-set tab_width 0

Change your working directory to the basepath of the
framework

Then call CodeSniffer on the wished directories
We are always testing the complete framework
You can simply reroute the output to a file like this
phpcs build-tools demos incubator library scripts tests > codingstandard.txt 

This codingstandard is still in progress and not finished
If you think there should be another sort of test added
