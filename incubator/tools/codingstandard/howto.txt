The coding standard is based upon Codesniffer.

To test the coding standard you must have the release 1.1.0.a of PHP_CodeSniffer installed.
You can get it from PEAR.

Delete the existing directory "Zend" within the "Standards" subdirectory in CodeSniffer.
Copy all files and the directory "Zend" from the frameworks Coding Standard to the "Standards"
directory of CodeSniffer.

Change the standard to use by CodeSniffer:
phpcs --config-set default_standard Zend

Change the tab usage to zero to check for tabs:
phpcs --config-set tab_width 0

Change your working directory to the basepath of the framework

Then call CodeSniffer on the wished directories
We are always testing the complete framework
You can simply reroute the output to a file like this
phpcs build-tools demos incubator library scripts tests > codingstandard.txt

This codingstandard is still in progress and not finished
Details about progressed tests can be found within the file
ZendCodingStandard.php
