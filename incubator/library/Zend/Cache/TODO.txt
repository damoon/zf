Priority 1 :

- end of unit tests :
	=> Core and Frontends are missing
	=> A "tests oriented" backend will be necessary
	(because we can't use phpunit3 mock objects)
	
- bug fixes :)

- end of Sqlite backend

- "Page" frontend (sort of "jpcache")
	=> to cache a whole page
	=> automatic cache id
	=> "HTTP not modified" header
	[...] (Mislav is working on this)

- work on the logging feature (which is not terminated)

- EXAMPLES.txt file


Priority 2 :

- complete documentation (zend format)
