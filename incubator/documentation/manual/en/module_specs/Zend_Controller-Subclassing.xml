            The <code>Zend_Controller</code> system was built with extensibility
            in mind, either by subclassing the existing classes or writing new
            classes that implement the interfaces
            <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Interface</code> and
            <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Interface</code> or extend the
            classes <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract</code>,
            <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract</code>, and
            <code>Zend_Controller_Action</code>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Possible reasons for subclassing include:

                        The existing URI routing system is not suitable in some
                        way, such as integrating into an existing website that
                        uses its own conventions for routing that do not mesh
                        with the routing mechanism provided with the Zend
                        Framework.

                        You need to implement routing for something completely
                        different.  The <code>Zend_Controller_Router</code>
                        class only deals with URIs.  It's possible and likely
                        that you might want to use the MVC pattern for
                        developing another type of program, such as a console or
                        GUI application.  In the case of a console application,
                        a custom request object could process command line
                        arguments.

                        The mechanism provided by
                        <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher</code> is not suitable.
                        The default configuration assumes a convention that
                        controllers are classes and actions are methods of those
                        classes.  However, there are many other strategies for
                        doing this.  One example would be where controllers are
                        directories and actions are files within those
                        directories.

                    <para>
                        You wish to provide additional capabilities that will be
                        inherited by all of your controllers.  For example,
                        <code>Zend_Controller_Action</code> does not integrate
                        with <code>Zend_View</code> by default.  However, you
                        could extend your own controller to do this, and using
                        it would not require modifying the supplied
                        <code>Zend_Controller_Router</code> or
                        <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher</code>.

                    <para>
                        You wish to log application exceptions when caught and
                        redirect to a generic error page. Extending
                        <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Http</code>, you could
                        modify <code>__toString()</code> to check for registered
                        exceptions, log them, and then redirect to an error
                        page.

            Please be careful when overriding significant parts of the system,
            particularly the dispatcher.  One of the advantages of
            <code>Zend_Controller</code> is that it establishes common
            conventions for building applications.  If too much of this default
            behavior is changed, some of these advantages are lost.  However,
            there are many different needs and one solution can't fit them all,
            so the freedom is provided if needed.

        <para>
            When subclassing any of the Zend_Controller classes, you are
            strongly encouraged to follow these conventions for naming or
            storing files.  Doing so will ensure that another programmer who is
            familiar with the Zend Framework will be able to understand your
            project easily.

            <title>Prefix</title>

            <para>
                Classes included with the Zend Framework follow a convention
                where every class is prefixed by "Zend_".  This is the prefix.
                We recommend that you name all of your classes in the same way,
                e.g. if your company name is Widget, Inc., the prefix might be
                "Widget_".

                The <code>Zend_Controller</code> classes are stored in the

            <para>
                When subclassing <code>Zend_Controller</code> classes, it is
                recommended that the new classes be stored in an identical
                structure under your prefix.  This will make them easy to find
                for someone during that learning process of reviewing the code
                for your project.

                For example, a project from Widget, Inc. which implements only a
                custom router might look like this:
            </para>
<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[

            <para>
                Notice in this example that the <code>Widget/Controller/</code>
                directory mirrors the <code>Zend/Controller/</code> directory
                wherever possible.  In this case, it provides the class
                <code>Widget_Controller_Router</code>, which would be either a
                subclass or replacement for <code>Zend_Controller_Router</code>
                implementing <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Interface</code>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Also, notice in the example above that a <code>README.txt</code>
                file has been placed in <code>Widget/Controller/</code>.  Zend
                strongly encourages you to document your projects through
                supplying separate tests and documentation for customers.
                However, we encourage you to also place a simple
                <code>README.txt</code> file right in the directory to briefly
                explain your changes and how they work.

            The request object is a container for the request environment. The
            controller chain really only needs to know how to set and retrieve the
            controller, action, optional parameters, and dispatched status. By
            default, the request will search its own parameters using the
            controller or action keys in order to determine the controller and

            Routing only occurs once: when the request is first received into
            the system.  The purpose of the router is to determine the
            controller, action, and optional parameters based on the request
            environment, and then set them in the request.  The request object
            is then passed to the dispatcher.  If it is not possible to map a
            route to a dispatch token, the router should do nothing to the
            request object.

            <code>Zend_Controller_Front</code> will first call the router to

            enters a dispatch loop.

        <para>
            In the loop, it first sets the request object's dispatched flag and
            then dispatches the request (instantiate the controller, call its
            action). If the action method (or a pre/postDispatch plugin) resets
            the request object's dispatched flag, the front controller will do
            another iteration of the dispatch loop with whatever action is
            currently set in the request object. This allows for actions to be
            processed sequentially until all work has been done.

            <code>isDispatchable()</code> checks if a request is
            dispatchable.  If it is, it returns <code>TRUE</code>.  Otherwise,
            it returns <code>FALSE</code>.  The definition of what is
            dispatchable is left to the class implementing the interface.  In
            the case of the default implementation,
            <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher</code>, it means that the
            controller file exists, the class exists within the file, and the
            action method exists within the class.
