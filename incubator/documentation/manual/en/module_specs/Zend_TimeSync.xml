        <code>Zend_TimeSync</code> is able to receive internet or network time from a timeserver using 
        the <emphasis role="strong">NTP</emphasis> or <emphasis role="strong">SNTP</emphasis> protocol.
        With <code>Zend_TimeSync</code> the Zend Framework is able to act indepentendly from the
        timesettings of the server where it is running.
    </para>

    <para>
        To be independent from the actual time of the server, <code>Zend_TimeSync</code> does internally
        work just with the difference of the real time which is send through NTP or SNTP and the internal
        servers time.

            <code>Zend_TimeSync</code> is not able to change the server's time, but it will return a
            <link linkend="zend.date.introduction">Zend_Date</link> instance from which the difference
            to the servers time can be worked with.

        <title>What is NTP?</title>

        <para>
            The <code>Network Time Protocol (<emphasis role="strong">NTP</emphasis>)</code> is a protocol
            for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data
            networks. NTP uses UDP port 123 as it's transport layer. See
            <link linkend="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">this wikipedia article</link>
            for details about this protocol.

        <title>What is SNTP?</title>

        <para>
            The <code>Simple Network Time Protocol (<emphasis role="strong">SNTP</emphasis>)</code> is a
            protocol for syncronising with clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency
            data networks. SNTP uses UDP port 37 as it's transport layer. It is nearly related to the
            <code>NTP</code> Protocol but simpler.

        <title>Problematic usage</title>

        <para>
            Be warned that when you are using <code>Zend_TimeSync</code> you will have to think about some
            details related to the structure of timesync and the web itself. How problems can be avoided
            and best practice will be described here. Read carefully before using <code>Zend_TimeSync</code>.

        <title>Decide which server to use</title>

        <para>
            You have to select the timeserver which you want to use very carefully. This has several reasons
            which are described here:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Distance
                </para>
                <para>
                    The distance from the server where your application is running to the timeserver you are
                    requesting. If your server is in europe it would make no sense to use a timeserver in
                    tahiti. Select always a server which is not far away. This reduces the time for the
                    request and reduced network load.                        
                </para>

                    Speed
                </para>
                <para>
                    How long it takes to receive the request is also relevant. Try some servers to get the
                    best result. If you are requesting a server which is never accessible you will always
                    have a unnecessary delay.

                    Splitting

                <para>
                    Do not use always the same server. All timeservers will lock request from servers which
                    are flooding the server. If your application makes excessive use of timeservers you
                    should not use a single timeserver but one of the pools described later.

        <para>
            So where can you find a timeserver ? Generally you can use any timeserver you know. This can be
            a timeserver within you LAN or any public timeserver you know. If you decide to use a public
            timeserver you should use a server pool. Serverpools are public addresses where you will get
            a random timeserver from the pool if you request the time. This way you will not have to split your
            requests. There are public serverpools avaiable for different regions so you will not have any of the
            problems mentioned above.
        </para>

        <para>
            Take a look at <link linkend="http://www.pool.ntp.org">pool.ntp.org</link> to get your nearest
            serverpool. So if your server is located within germany for example you can connect to
            <code>server 0.<emphasis role="strong">de</emphasis>.pool.ntp.org</code> and so on.
