            Zend_Http_Client provides an easy interface for preforming Hyper-Text 
            Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. Zend_Http_Client supports most simple 
            features expected from an HTTP client, as well as some more complex 
            features such as HTTP authentication and file uploads. Successful 
            requests (and most unsuccessful ones too) return a Zend_Http_Response 
            object, which provides access to the response's headers and body (see 
            <xref linkend="zend.http.response" />).
        </para>
        <para>
            The class constructor optionally accepts a URL as it's first parameter
            (can be either a string or a Zend_Uri_Http object), and an optional 
            array of configuration parameters. Both can be left out, 
            and set later using the setUri() and setConfig() methods.

        <title>Performing Basic HTTP Requests</title>
        <para>
            Performing simple HTTP requests is very easily done using the 
            request() method, and rarely needs more than three lines of code:
            <example>
                <title>Preforming a Simple GET Request</title>
                <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
    require_once 'Zend/Http/Client.php';

    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('http://example.org');
    $response = $client->request();
?>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            The request() method takes one optional parameter - the request method.
            This can be either GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS or 
            CONNECT as defined by the HTTP protocol
            <footnote>
              <para>
                See RFC 2616 - <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html" />.
              </para>
            </footnote>. 
            For convenience, these are all defined as class constants:
            Zend_Http_Request::GET, Zend_Http_Request::POST and so on.
        </para>
        <para>
            If no method is specified, the method set by the last setMethod()
            call is used. If setMethod() was never called, the default request
            method is GET (see the above example).

        <title>Adding GET and POST parameters </title>
        <para>
            Adding GET parameters to an HTTP request is quite simple, and can 
            be done either by specifying them as part of the URL, or by using
            the setParameterGet() method. 
            This method takes the GET parameter's name as it's first parameter,
            and the GET parameter's value as it's second parameter. 
            For convenience, the setParameterGet() method can also accept a
            single associative array of name => value GET variables - which may
            be more comfortable when several GET parameters need to be set.
            <example>
                <title>Setting GET Parameters</title>
                <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
    // Setting a get parameter using the setParameterGet method
    $client->setParameterGet('knight', 'lancelot');

    // This is equivalent to setting such URL:
    $client->setUri('http://example.com/index.php?knight=lancelot');
    
    // Adding several parameters with one call
    $client->setParameterGet(array(
        'first_name'  => 'Bender',
        'middle_name' => 'Bending'
        'made_in'     => 'Mexico',
    ));

            </example>
        </para>
        <para>
            While GET parameters can be sent with every request method, POST
            parameters are only sent in the body of POST requests. Adding POST
            parameters to a request is very similar to adding GET parameters, 
            and can be done with the setParameterPost() method, which is
            similar to the setParameterGet() method in structure.
            <example>
                <title>Setting POST Parameters</title>
                <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
    // Setting a POST parameter
    $client->setParameterPost('language', 'fr');
    
    // Setting several POST parameters, one of them with several values
    $client->setParameterPost(array(
        'language'  => 'es',
        'country'   => 'ar',
        'selection' => array(45, 32, 80)
    ));
?>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            Note that when sending POST requests, you can set both GET and 
            POST parameters. On the other hand, while setting POST parameters
            for a non-POST request will not trigger and error, it is useless. 
            Unless the request is a POST request, POST parameters are simply 
            ignored.

    <sect2 id="zend.http.client.redirections">
        <title>HTTP Redirections</title>
        <para>
            By default, Zend_Http_Client automatically handles HTTP redirections,
            and will follow up to 5 redirections. This can be changed by setting 
            the 'maxredirects' configuration parameter. 
        </para>
        <para>
            According to the HTTP/1.1 RFC, HTTP 301 and 302 responses should be
            treated by the client by resending the same request to the 
            specified location - using the same request method. However, most 
            clients to not implement this and always use a GET request when 
            redirecting. By default, Zend_Http_Client does the same - when 
            redirecting on a 301 or 302 response, all GET and POST parameters
            are reset, and a GET request is sent to the new location. This 
            behavior can be changed by setting the 'strictredirects' configuration
            parameter to boolean TRUE:
            <example>
                <title>Forcing RFC 2616 Strict Redirections on 301 and 302 Responses</title>
                <programlisting role="php">

?>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
        </para>
        <para>
            You can always get the number of redirections done after sending a

        	required. This is done using the setCookie() method. This method

        <para>
            Zend_Http_Client also provides the means for cookie stickiness -
            that is having the client internally store all sent and received
            cookies, and resend them automatically on subsequent requests. This
            is useful, for example when you need to log in to a remote site 
            first and receive and authentication or session ID cookie before 
            sending further requests.

            Setting custom headers can be done by using the setHeaders() method.
            This method is quite diverse and can be used in several ways, as 
            the following example shows:
            <example>

    <sect2 id="zend.http.client.file_uploads">
        <title>File Uploads</title>
        <para>
            You can upload files through HTTP using the setFileUpload method. 
            This method takes a file name as the first parameter, a form name 
            as the second parameter, and data as a third optional parameter. 
            If the third data parameter is null, the first file name parameter
            is considered to be a real file on disk, and Zend_Http_Client will
            try to read this file and upload it. If the data parameter is not
            null, the first file name parameter will be sent as the file name,
            but no actual file needs to exist on the disk.
            The second form name parameter is always required, and is equivalent
            to the "name" attribute of an &gt;input&lt; tag, if the file was to
            be uploaded through an HTML form.
            A fourth optional parameter provides the file's content-type. If
            not specified, and Zend_Http_Client reads the file from the disk,
            the mime_content_type function will be used to guess the file's 
            content type, if it is available. In any case, the default MIME
            type will be application/octet-stream.
            <example>
                <title>Using setFileUpload to Upload Files</title>
                <programlisting role="php">

    // Send the files
    $client->submit('POST');
?>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            In the first example, the $text variable is uploaded and will be
            available as $_FILES['upload'] on the server side. In the second
            example, the existing file /tmp/Backup.tar.gz is uploaded to the 
            server and will be available as $_FILES['bufile']. The content type
            will be guesses automatically if possible - and if not, the content
            type will be set to 'application/octet-stream'. 
        </para>

            <title>Uploading files</title>
            <para>
                When uploading files, the HTTP request content-type is 
                automatically set to multipart/form-data. Keep in mind that
                you must send a POST or PUT request in order to upload files. 
                Most servers will ignore the requests body on other request
                methods.

        <title>Sending Raw POST Data</title>
        <para>
            You can use a Zend_Http_Client to send raw POST data using the
            setRawData() method. This method takes two parameters: the first
            is the data to send in the request body. The second optional
            parameter is the content-type of the data. While this parameter is
            optional, you should usually set it before sending the request - 
            either using setRawData(), or with another method: setEncType().
            <example>
                <title>Sending Raw POST Data</title>
                <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
    $xml = '<book>' . 
           '  <title>Islands in the Stream</title>' . 
           '  <author>Ernest Hemingway</author>' . 
           '  <year>1970</year>' . 
           '</book>';
           
    $client->setRawData($xml, 'text/xml')->request('POST');
    
    // Another way to do the same thing:
    $client->setRawData($xml)->setEncType('text/xml')->request('POST');
?>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
            The data should be available on the server side through PHP's 
            $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA variable or through the php://input stream.
        </para>
        <note>
            <title>Using raw POST data</title>
            <para>
                Setting raw POST data for a request will override any POST
                parameters or file uploads. You should not try to use both on
                the same request. Keep in mind that most servers will ignore 
                the request body unless you send a POST request.

        <title>HTTP Authentication</title>
        <para>
            Currently, Zend_Http_Client only supports basic HTTP authentication.
            This feature is utilized using the setAuth() method. The method 
            takes 3 parameters: The user name, the password and an optional
            authentication type parameter. As mentioned, currently only basic
            authentication is supported (digest authentication support is
            planned).
            <example>
                <title>Setting HTTP Authentication User and Password</title>
                <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[<?php
    // Using basic authentication
    $client->setAuth('shahar', 'myPassword!', Zend_Http_Client::AUTH_BASIC);
    
    // Since basic auth is default, you can just do this:
    $client->setAuth('shahar', 'myPassword!');
?>]]></programlisting>

    <sect2 id="zend.http.client.multiple_requests">
        <title>Sending Multiple Requests With the Same Client</title>
        <para>
            Zend_Http_Client was also designed specifically to handle several
            consecutive requests with the same object. This is useful in cases
            where a script requires data to be fetched from several places, or
            when accessing a specific HTTP resource requires logging in and 
            obtaining a session cookie, for example. 
        </para>
        <para>
            When performing several requests to the same host, it is highly 
            recommended to enable the 'keepalive' configuration flag. This way,
            if the server supports keep-alive connections, the connection to the
            server will only be closed once all requests are done and the Client
            object is destroyed. This prevents the overhead of opening and 
            closing TCP connections to the server.
        </para>
        <para>
            When you perform several requests with the same client, but want
            to make sure all the request-specific parameters are cleared, you
            should use the resetParameters() method. This ensures that GET and
            POST parameters, request body and request-specific headers are 
            reset and are not reused in the next request.
        </para>
        <note>
            <title>Reseting parameters</title>
            <para>
                Note that non-request specific headers are not reset when the 
                resetParameters method is used. As a matter of fact, only the
                'Content-length' and 'Content-type' headers are reset. This 
                allows you to set-and-forget headers like 'Accept-language' and
                'Accept-encoding'
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            Another feature designed specifically for consecutive requests is 
            the Cookie Jar object. Cookie Jars allow you to automatically save
            cookies set by the server in the first request, and send them on
            consecutive requests transparently. This allows, for example, going
            through an authentication request before sending the actual data
            fetching request.
        </para>.
        <para>
            If your application requires one authentication request per user,
            and consecutive requests might be performed in more than one script
            in your application, it might be a good idea to store the Cookie Jar
            object in the user's session. This way, you will only need to 
            authenticate the user once every session.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Performing consecutive requests with one client</title>
            <programlisting role="php">

    if (isset($_SESSION['cookiejar']) &&

        $client->request(Zend_Http_Client::POST);
        
        // Now, clear parameters and set the URI to the original one

    <sect2 id="zend.http.client.adapters">
        <title>Connection Adapters</title>
        <para>
            Zend_Http_Client is based on a connection adapter design. The
            connection adapter is the object in charge of performing the 
            actual connection to the server, as well as writing requests 
            and writing responses.
            This connection adapter can be replaced, and you can create and
            extend the default connection adapter to suite your special needs,
            without the need to extend or replace the entire HTTP client
            class, and with the same interface.
        </para>
        <para>
            Currently, the Zend_Http_Client class provides one connection adapter,
            the Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Socket interface which is the default
            adapter. This is a plain socket based adapter, which does not require
            any special PHP extension.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can create your own connection adapters and use them. In order
            to do so, you must create your own class that implements the 
            Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Interface interface. You could, for 
            example, create a connection adapter that uses persistent sockets,
            or a connection adapter with caching abilities, and use them as 
            needed in your application.
        </para>
        <para>
            In order to use a custom connection adapter, you must set the 
            'adapter' configuration flag to the name of your adapter class.
