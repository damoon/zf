        The Zend_Server family of classes provides functionality for the various
        server classes, including Zend_XmlRpc_Server, Zend_Rest_Server,
        and Zend_Soap_Wsdl. Zend_Server_Interface provides an interface that
        mimics PHP 5's SoapServer class; all server classes should implement this
        interface in order to provide a standard API.

        The Zend_Server_Reflection tree provides a standard mechanism for
        performing function and class introspection for use as callbacks with
        the server classes.
