      <para>With web applications written using PHP, a <emphasis
      role="bold">session</emphasis> represents a logical, one-to-one
      connection between server-side, persistent state data and a particular
      user agent client (e.g. web browser). Zend_Session helps manage and
      preserve session data, a logical complement of cookie data, across
      multiple page requests by the same client. Unlike cookie data, session
      data is not stored on the client side, and it is only shared with the
      client when server-side source code makes the data available via a
      response to a request from the client. For the purposes of this
      component and documentation, session data refers to the server-side data
      managed by Zend_Session.</para>

      <para>The Zend_Session component wraps the existing PHP ext/session to
      provide a standardized, object-oriented interface for working with
      sessions, including both anonymous and login sessions. Zend_Auth, the
      authentication component of the ZF uses Zend_Session to store some
      information associated with login sessions. Since Zend_Session uses the
      normal PHP session functions internally, all the usual configuration
      options and settings apply (see <link
      linkend="http://www.php.net/session">http://www.php.net/session</link>).
      Thus, a session id, stored either in a cookie or URLs, maintains the
      association between a client and session state data.</para>

      <para>The default <link
      linkend="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php">ext/session
      save handler</link> does not solve the problem of maintaining this
      association, when a client may connect to any sever in a cluster of
      servers, since session state data is saved to the local server only. A
      list of appropriate save handlers will be provided, when
      available.</para>
