Priority 1 :

- end of the complete documentation (zend format)

- end of "Page" frontend (clone of "jpcache")
	=> to cache a whole page
	=> automatic cache id
	=> "HTTP not modified" header
	[...] (Mislav is working on this) 


Priority 2 :

- new backends (memcached, shmop...)
- an integrated cache for Zend_Controler ?
- an integrated cache for Zend XMLRPC ?
- improve logging feature with debug support (only warnings are implemented now)
