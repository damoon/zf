	Optional:
	
	  - Firebug Tracing Console: http://getfirebug.com/releases/firebug/1.4X/
	  
Instructions:

  1) Place file called "zend_toolbar@framework.zend.com" containing path to "/extension"
     into "extensions" directory of a firefox development profile
     
  2) Create a "/extension/build.local.properties" file containing:
  
			firefox.bin.path = <path to firefox binary>
			firefox.profile.name = <firefox profile name>
			
  3) Run "phing dev-launch"

Debugging:

	You can set the Firebug Tracing Console to auto-open to see debug messages during development:
	
	  1) Run "phing dev-launch"
	  
	  2) In firefox go to "about:config"
	  
	  3) Set "extensions.Zend_Toolbar.alwaysOpenTraceConsole" to "true"
	  
	  4) Restart firefox

	  5) When the tracing console opens go to "Options" to enable desired logging groups

	You can log messages with:
	
	  console.dump('<Label>', variable, '<Group Name>');
	  
	  Where <Group Name> defaults to "Temporary" and may be omitted.
