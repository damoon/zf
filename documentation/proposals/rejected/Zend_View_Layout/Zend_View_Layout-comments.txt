Subtemplates can already be rendered by calling 
$this->render($scriptName) again inside the view
script.  Helpers can also be written to do this.

There are a variety of ways to build layouts 
using this method and creating a special subclass of
Zend_View specifically to do this isn't necessary.

However, we are possibly going to make some changes to
Zend_View in the future, and will consider building 
in a mechanism specifically for layouts.
