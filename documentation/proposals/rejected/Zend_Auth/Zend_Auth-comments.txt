Decision: Rejected

There are now at least five different proposals for Zend_Auth 
classes or combination Auth/ACL classes.  We will collect them
all and place them in this folder for future reference.

At this time, we have decided not to implement any of these 
concrete classes as part of the Zend Framework core.

However, since auth support has been a relatively common request,
we have decided to provide a very basic auth suggestion in the form 
of an abstract class upon which users could build their own auth system.  
In time, if we see common needs and patterns of use, we may choose to 
revisit this decision and provide a basic solution.
