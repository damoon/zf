Hi,

I was surpised to see the proposal for the Zend_Tree show up in Cal Evans's
framework roundup at http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/132, therefore,
I've decided to come up with an overview of what has been discussed so far.

Quote from Cal Evans's article:
"There seemed to be some early confusion on this proposal and how it differs
from a DOM. Finally Casper Langemeijer submitted an explanation that put
everything in perspective. He explains a bit and points people to a tutorial
that helps clarify the concepts behind the Zend_Tree proposal."

The link: http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/ will
clear up any confusion.

So far we came up with the following operations:

* Enumerating all the items;
* Searching for an item;
* Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree;
* Deleting an item;
* Removing a whole section of a tree;
* Adding a whole section to a tree;
* Finding the root for any node.
* Manipulate hierarchical data;
* Make information easy to search;
* Manipulate sorted lists of data;
* Exporting to a variety of different formats (eg DHTML, XML, etc)
* Searching a Tree (proposal)

Johannes Orth was kind enough to share some of his ideas with us. And an
example usage would be as follows (regardless of the naming conventions):

$tree = new Tree();
$tree->import(new Tree_Import_XML('foobar.xml'));
$data = $tree->export(new Tree_HTML_Menu());

$menu = new HTML_Menu($data, 'tree');
$menu->show();

You are also able to switch data sources:

$tree = new Tree();
$tree->import(new Tree_Import_XML('foobar.xml'));
$tree->export(new Tree_RDBMS_Menu($dbconfig));

And now you can read your menu from the database:

$tree = new Tree();
$tree->import(new Tree_Import_RDBMS($dbconfig));
$data = $tree->export(new Tree_HTML_Menu());

$menu = new HTML_Menu($data, 'tree');
$menu->show();


Thank you all for sharing your thoughts!
