Decision: Rejected

At this time, we see this as a general-purpose class
that would be useful but doesn't fit into our core.

There is a PEAR package, Tree, with very similar goals.
However, it hasn't been updated since 2003.  See:
http://pear.php.net/package/Tree

There is also an actively supported tree class as part of 
the Horde framework, see:
http://dev.horde.org/api/framework/Horde_Tree/Horde_Tree.html

We'd suggest contacting these developers to see if you can
contribute your ideas to further their efforts.
