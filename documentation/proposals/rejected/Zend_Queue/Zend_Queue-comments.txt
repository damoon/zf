Decision: Rejected

We think that the proposal is too simplistic.  It doesn't 
provide any significant benefit from simply creating a 
database table for a queue and using Zend_Db_Table as a
FIFO to push and pop rows.   

We feel it also doesn't deal with basic features needed in 
a queue such as transactional state and priorities.  

For the messenging to be really useful and more than just 
a glorified cron job, a persistent (non-PHP) component 
is very desirable, e.g. Spread (http://www.spread.org/)
or ActiveMQ (http://www.activemq.org/).  This is outside 
the scope of the Zend Framework.

We do see usefulness in implementing the simpler messenging 
protocols such as STOMP (http://stomp.codehaus.org/) to
allow PHP to be a client to a message queue.  

However, we do not think that it would be of interest to the 
majority of our users, so these should not be part of our core.
