Decision: Rejected

Initially, we thought that this would be good for inclusion
in the Zend Framework.  After more discussion, we all
agree that this wouldn't be used by the majority of our
users, so it should not be part of our core.

PEAR uses concrete classes for each encryption and note that 
there is significant encryption support in PEAR already.  
We don't need to duplicate good work going on there.  See: 
http://pear.php.net/packages.php?catpid=6&catname=Encryption

One differentiator between this proposal and the PEAR
classes is that this one proposes a unified API.  However, 
with so many kinds of encryptions, we question if this 
really makes sense.  For example, we don't see how to 
effective mold private/public key & block ciphers
into the same API, even when using adaptation as proposed.

We suggest contributing your ideas on encryption to PEAR 
so their project can benefit from your efforts.
