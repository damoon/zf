Decision: Rejected

We are presently working with IBM on this integration,
but it is still early in the process.

The final version will not require a special controller
subclass for AJAX, or storing a special AJAX object
in the registry that must be retrieved by each controller.

Please continue to watch the SVN and participate in the
mailing list and help us as it begins to take shape
in the core.
