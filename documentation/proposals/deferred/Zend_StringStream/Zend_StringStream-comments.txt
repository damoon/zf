Decision: Deferred

We think that this is a clever and handy idea, and one that
we will probably have a good use for in the future.

It's not clear to us that the majority of users could
benefit from this in the public API.  Our guess is that
this would be primarily used as an internal service class,
although we wouldn't try to restrict it.

However, at this time we don't have anything in the Zend
Framework that will immediately benefit from it, so we're 
going to defer this component until we can make good 
use of it.  We do anticipate that we will want to use it.
