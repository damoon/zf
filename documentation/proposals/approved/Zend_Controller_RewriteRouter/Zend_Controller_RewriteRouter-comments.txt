Decision: Accepted

Since the time that this proposal was made with code by 
Martel Valgoerad, Jared Williams has submitted an alternate
solution.  Both use very similar routing rules but the 
implementation details are different.

We have conditionally accepted this proposal, with the
understanding that Zend will work together with Martel
and Jared to develop a solution with the best features
from each.  Zend will first merge this code, taking the
best features from each, and will the commit this to
the incubator after giving it a real-life test.  We would 
then like Jared and Martel to work with us to further 
advance it.

This router will completely replace the existing router
solution.  Common issues that have been raised on the 
mailing list, particularly better support for subdirectories
(shared hosters), must be addressed by this new solution.
