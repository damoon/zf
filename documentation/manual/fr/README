How to build the docs:

- Install libxml2-devel package so that you have the "xsltproc" tool.

On windows; install cygwin and the autoconf, make, libxml2-devel packages.

- run autoconf in this dir
- run ./configure in this dir
- run make

the docs will appear in the html dir.

When developing content, you can run "make check" to verify that your docbook is valid.
