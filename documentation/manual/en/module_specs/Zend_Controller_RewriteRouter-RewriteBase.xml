	<title>Base URL and subdirectories</title>

	<para>
		Unlike the original Router, RewriteRouter can be used in subdirectories - it automatically detects your base URL and
		sets it accordingly. For example: if you keep your <code>index.php</code> in a webserver subdirectory named
		<code>/projects/myapp/index.php</code> rewrite base (base URL) will be set to <code>/projects/myapp</code>. This string will then be 
		stripped from the beginning of the path before calculating any route matches. This frees one from the necessity of prepending it to
		any of your routes. The route of <code>'user/:username'</code> will match URIs like
		<code>http://localhost/projects/myapp/user/martel</code> and <code>http://example.com/user/martel</code>.
	</para>

	<note>
	    <title>Case sensitivity</title>
	    <para>
    		Automatic rewrite base is case sensitive, so make sure your URL will match a subdirectory name in a filesystem
	    	(even on Windows machines). If it doesn't you will get to noRoute action.
		</para>
	</note>

	<para>
		Should rewrite base be detected incorrectly you can override it with your own base path with the help of the
		setRewriteBase method of the RewriteRouter class:
	</para>

	<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
$router->setRewriteBase('/projects/myapp');]]></programlisting>

	<note>
		This step won't be necessary in most cases and is strongly discouraged as it introduces another configuration variable
		which would have to be altered when one moves code to another directory configuration.
