        The default behavior of sessions can be modified using the static methods in Zend_Session_Core. All management
        and manipulation of global session management occurs using Zend_Session_Core, including configuration of the

                            For example, an attacker can visit the victim's website to obtain a session cookie. Then
                            edit the cookie path to his own domain on the same server, before visiting his own website
                            to execute <code>var_dump($_SESSION)</code>. Armed with detailed knowledge of the victim's
                            use of data in their sessions, the attacker can then modify the session state (poisoning the
                            session), alter the cookie path back to the victim's website, and then make requests from
                            the victim's website using the poisoned session. Even if two applications on the same server
                            do not have read/write access to the other application's save_path, if the save_path is
                            guessable, and the attacker has control over one of these two websites, the attacker could
                            alter their website's save_path to use the other's save_path, and thus accomplish session
                            poisoning, under some common configurations of PHP. Thus, the value for save_path should not
                            be made public knowledge, and should be altered to a secure location unique to each
                            application.

                                If this setting is not enabled, an attacker can easily fix victim's session ids, using
                                links on the attacker's website, such as
                                <code>http://www.victim-website.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=fixed_session_id</code>. The
                                fixation works, if the victim does not already have a session id cookie for
                                victim-website.com. Once a victim is using a known session id, the attacker can then
                                attempt to hijack the session by pretending to be the victim, and emulating the victim's
                                user agent.

            <title>Introduction: Session Identifiers</title>

            <para>
                Introduction: Best practice in relation to using sessions with ZF calls for using a browser cookie (i.e.
                a normal cookie stored in your web browser), instead of embedding a unique session identifier in URLs as
                a means to track individual users. By default this component uses only cookies to maintain session
                identifiers. The cookie's value is the unique identifier of your browser's session. PHP's ext/session
                uses this identifier to maintain a unique one-to-one relationship between website visitors, and
                persistent session data storage unique to each visitor. Zend_Session* wraps this storage mechanism
                (<code>$_SESSION</code>) with an object-oriented interface. Unfortunately, if an attacker gains access
                to the value of the cookie (the session id), an attacker might be able to hijack a visitor's session.
                This problem is not unique to PHP, or the Zend Framework. The <code>regenerateId()</code> method allows
                an application to change the session id (stored in the visitor's cookie) to a new, random, unpredictable
                value. Note: Although not the same, to make this section easier to read, we use the terms "user agent"
                and "web browser" interchangeably.
            </para>

            <para>
                Why?: If an attacker obtains a valid session identifier, an attacker might be able to impersonate a
                valid user (the victim), and then obtain access to confidential information or otherwise manipulate the
                victim's data managed by your application. Changing session ids helps protect against session hijacking.
                If the session id is changed, and an attacker does not know the new value, the attacker can not use the
                new session id in their attempts to hijack the visitor's session. Even if an attacker gains access to an
                old session id, <code>regenerateId()</code> also moves the session data from the old session id "handle"
                to the new one, so no data remains accessible via the old session id.
            </para>

            <para>
                When to use regenerateId(): Adding <code>Zend_Session_Core::regenerateId()</code> to your Zend Framework
                bootstrap yields one of the safest and most secure ways to regenerate session id's in user agent
                cookies. If there is no conditional logic to determine when to regenerate the session id, then there are
                no flaws in that logic. Although regenerating on every request prevents several possible avenues of
                attack, not everyone wants the associated small performance and bandwidth cost. Thus, applications
                commonly try to dynamically determine situations of greater risk, and only regenerate the session ids in
                those situations. Whenever a website visitor's session's privileges are "escalated" (e.g. a visitor
                re-authenticates their identity before editing their personal "profile"), or whenever a security
                "sensitive" session parameter change occurs, consider using <code>regenerateId()</code> to create a new
                session id. If you call the <code>rememberMe()</code> function, then don't use
                <code>regenerateId()</code>, since the former calls the latter. If a user has successfully logged into
                your website, use <code>rememberMe()</code> instead of <code>regenerateId()</code>.

            <para>
                XSS problems occur frequently. Rather than expecting to never have a XSS problem with an application,
                plan for it by following best practices to help minimize damage, if it occurs. With XSS, an attacker
                does not need direct access to a victim's network traffic. If the victim already has a session cookie,
                Javascript XSS might allow an attacker to read the cookie and steal the session. For victims with no
                session cookies, using XSS to inject Javascript, an attacker could create a session id cookie on the
                victim's browser with a known value, then set an identical cookie on the attacker's system, in order to
                hijack the victim's session. If the victim visited an attacker's website, then the attacker can also
                emulate most other identifiable characteristics of the victim's user agent. If your website has an XSS
                vulnerability, the attacker might be able to insert an AJAX Javascript that secretly "visits" the
                attacker's website, so that the attacker knows the victim's browser characteristics and becomes aware of
                a compromised session at the victim website. However, the attacker can not arbitrarily alter the
                server-side state of PHP sessions, provided the developer has correctly set the value for the
                <code>save_path</code> option.
            </para>

            <para>
                By itself, calling <code>Zend_Session_Core::regenerateId()</code> when the user's session is first used,
                does not prevent session fixation attacks, unless you can distinguish between a session originated by an
                attacker emulating the victim. At first, this might sound contradictory to previous statement above,
                until we consider an attacker who first initiates a real session on your website. The session is "first
                used" by the attacker, who then knows the result of the initialization (<code>regenerateId()</code>).
                The attacker then uses the new session id in combination with an XSS vulnerability, or injects the
                session id via a link on the attacker's website (works if <code>use_only_cookies = off</code>).
            </para>

            <para>
                If you can distinguish between an attacker and victim using the same session id, then session hijacking
                can be dealt with directly. However, such distinctions usually involve some form of usability tradeoffs,
                because the methods of distinction are often imprecise. For example, if a request is received from an IP
                in a different country than the IP of the request when the session was created, then the new request
                probably belongs to an attacker. Under the following conditions, there might not be any way for a
                website application to distinguish between a victim and an attacker:

            Ordinarily, sessions end when the user agent ends its "session", such as when an end user closes their
            browser window. However, when a user logs in to your website, they might want their virtual session to last
            for 24 hours, or even longer. Forum software commonly gives the user a choice for how long their session
            should last. Use <code>Zend_Session_Core::rememberMe()</code> to send an updated session cookie to the user
            agent with a lifetime defaulting to <code>remember_me_seconds</code>, which is set to 2 weeks, unless you
            modify that value using <code>setOptions()</code>. To help thwart session fixation/hijacking, use this
            function when a user successfully authenticates and you application performs a "login".

        <para>
            <code>Zend_Session_Core::destroy()</code> destroys all of the persistent data associated with the current
            session. However, no variables in PHP are affected, so your namespaced sessions (instances of
            <code>Zend_Session</code>) remain readable. To complete a "logout", set the optional parameter to true
            (default is true) to also delete the user agent's session id cookie. The optinal <code>$readonly</code>
            parameter removes the ability for Zend_Session instances, and Zend_Session_Core methods to write to the
            session data store (i.e. $_SESSION).

        <para>
            This method does absolutely nothing more than toggle a flag in Zend_Session_Core to prevent further writing
            to the session data store (i.e. <code>$_SESSION</code>). We are specifically requesting feedback on this
            feature. Potential uses/abuses might include temporarily disabling the use of <code>Zend_Session</code>
            instances or <code>Zend_Session_Core</code> methods to write to the session data store, while execution is
            transfered to view-related code. Attempts to perform actions involving writes via these instances or methods
            will throw an error.

            Shutdown the sesssion, close writing and detach $_SESSION from the back-end storage mechanism. This will
            complete the internal data transformation on this request. The optional $readonly boolean parameter can
            remove write access (i.e. throw error if any Zend_Session or Zend_Session_Core methods attempt writes).

                By default, <code>$readonly</code> is enabled and further actions involving writing to the session data
                store will throw an error. However, some legacy application might expect $_SESSION to remain writeable
                after ending the session via session_write_close(). Although not considered "best practice", the
                <code>$readonly</code> option is available for those who need it.

            This method sends an expired session id cookie, causing the client to delete the session cookie. Sometimes

        <para>
            Instead of creating a Zend_Session instance for a namespace, and iterating over its contents to unset each
            entry, use <code>namespaceUnset($namespace)</code> to efficiently unset (remove) an entire namespace and its
            contents. As with all arrays in PHP, if a variable containing an array is unset, and the array contains
            other objects, those objects will remain available, if they were also stored in other array/objects that
            remain accessible via other variables. So do not expect <code>namespaceUnset()</code> to actually do a
            "deep" unsetting/deleting of the contents of the entries in the namespace. For a more detailed explanation,
            please see
