        The Zend_Filter component provides a set of commonly needed data filters. It also provides a simple
        filter chaining mechanism by which multiple filters may be applied to a single datum in a
        user-defined order.

        In the physical world, a filter is typically used for removing unwanted portions of input, and the
        desired portion of the input passes through as filter output (e.g., coffee). In such scenarios, a
        filter is an operator that produces a subset of the input. This type of filtering is useful for web
        applications - removing illegal input, trimming unnecessary white space, etc.

        This basic definition of a filter may be extended to include generalized transformations upon input.
        A common transformation applied in web applications is the escaping of HTML entities. For example, if
        a form field is automatically populated with untrusted input (e.g., from a web browser), this value
        should either be free of HTML entities or contain only escaped HTML entities, in order to prevent
        undesired behavior and security vulnerabilities. To meet this requirement, HTML entities that appear
        in the input must either be removed or escaped. Of course, which approach is more appropriate depends
        on the situation. A filter that removes the HTML entities operates within the scope of the first
        definition of filter - an operator that produces a subset of the input. A filter that escapes the
        HTML entities, however, transforms the input (e.g., "<code>&amp;</code>" is transformed to
        "<code>&amp;amp;</code>"). Supporting such use cases for web developers is important, and "to
        filter," in the context of using Zend_Filter, means to perform some transformations upon input data.

        Having this filter definition established provides the foundation for
        <code>Zend_Filter_Interface</code>, which requires a single method named <code>filter()</code> to be
        implemented by a filter class.

        Following is a basic example of using a filter upon two input data, the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>)
        and double quote (<code>&quot;</code>) characters:

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once 'Zend/Filter/HtmlEntities.php';
$htmlEntities = new Zend_Filter_HtmlEntities();
echo $htmlEntities->filter('&'); // &amp;
echo $htmlEntities->filter('"'); // &quot;]]></programlisting>

    </para>
