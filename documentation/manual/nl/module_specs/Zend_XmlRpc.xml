        XML-RPC is a "...remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be transmitted, processed and returned." (<ulink url="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC Home Page</ulink>).

      The Zend Framework implementation for an XML-RPC client (and in the future for an XML-RPC server) makes the usage of XML-RPC even simpler, trying to make the usage of XML-RPC similar as possible to the PHP5 <ulink url="http://www.php.net/soap">SOAP web service extension</ulink>.
