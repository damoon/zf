            Zend_Search_Lucene is designed to work with UTF-8 charset. Index files store
            unicode data in Java's "modified UTF-8 encoding". Zend_Search_Lucene core
            completely supports it with one exception.

                   Zend_Search_Lucene supports only Basic Multilingual Plane
                   (BMP) characters (from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF) and doesn't support
                   "supplementary characters" (characters whose code points are
                   greater than 0xFFFF)
               </para>

                   Java 2 represents these characters as a pair of char (16-bit)
                   values, the first from the high-surrogates range (0xD800-0xDBFF),
                   the second from the low-surrogates range (0xDC00-0xDFFF). Then
                   they are encoded as usual UTF-8 characters in six bytes.
                   Standard UTF-8 representation uses four bytes for supplementary
                   characters.

            However, text analyzers and query parser use
            ctype_alpha() for tokenizing text and queries. ctype_alpha() doesn't support
            UTF-8 and needs to be replaced by something else in nearest future.

            Before that we are strongly recomend to convert your data into ASCII
            representation
