            Zend_Search_Lucene is a general purpose text search engine written entirely in PHP 5.
            Since it stores its index on the filesystem and does not require a database
            server, it can add search capabilities to almost any PHP-driven website.
            Zend_Search_Lucene supports the following features:

            Zend_Search_Lucene was derived from the Apache Lucene project.  For more information on Lucene, visit

            <para>
                Zend_Search_Lucene operates with documents as atomic subjects for indexing.  A document is
                divided into named fields, and fields have content that can be searched.
            </para>

            <para>
                A document is represented by the Zend_Search_Lucene_Document object, and this object contains
                Zend_Search_Lucene_Field objects that represent the fields.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is important to note that any kind of information can be added to the index.
                Application-specific information or metadata can be stored in the document
                fields, and later retrieved with the document during search.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is the responsibility of your application to control the indexer.
                This means that data can be indexed from any source
                that is accessible by your application.  For example, this could be the
                filesystem, a database, an HTML form, etc.
            </para>

            <para>
                <code>Zend_Search_Lucene_Field</code> class provides several static methods to create fields with
                different characteristics:
            </para>

            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$doc = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Document();

// Field is not tokenized, but is indexed and stored within the index.
// Stored fields can be retrived from the index.
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Keyword('doctype',
                                                 'autogenerated'));

// Field is not tokenized nor indexed, but is stored in the index.
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnIndexed('created',
                                                   time()));

// Binary String valued Field that is not tokenized nor indexed,
// but is stored in the index.
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Binary('icon',
                                                $iconData));

// Field is tokenized and indexed, and is stored in the index.
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Text('annotation',
                                              'Document annotation text'));

// Field is tokenized and indexed, but that is not stored in the index.
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnStored('contents',
                                                  'My document content'));

?>]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                Each of these methods (excluding <code>Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Binary()</code> method) has optional
                <code>$encoding</code> paremeter. It specifies input data encoding.
            </para>

            <para>
                Encoding may differ for different documents as well as for different fields within one document:

                <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
$doc = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Document();
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::Text('title', $title, 'iso-8859-1'));
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnStored('contents', $contents, 'utf-8'));
?>]]></programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                If encoding parameter is omitted, then current locale is used at processing time. For example:
                <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE.iso-8859-1');
...
$doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnStored('contents', $contents));
?>]]></programlisting>
            </para>

            <para>
                Fields are always stored and returned from index in UTF-8 encoding. Conversion to UTF-8 proceeds
                automatically.
            </para>

            <para>
                Text analyzers (<link linkend="zend.search.extending.analysis">see below</link>) may also convert text
                to some other encodings. Actually, default analyzer converts text to 'ASCII//TRANSLIT' encoding.
                Be care with this, such translation may depend on current locale.
            </para>

            <para>
                Fields' names are defined only by your own choice.
            </para>

            <para>
                Java Lucene uses "contents" field as a default field to search.
                Zend_Search_Lucene searches through all fiels by default, but it's also possible to change this behavior.

                    <code>Keyword</code> fields are stored and indexed, meaning that they can be searched as well
                    as displayed in search results. They are not split up into separate words by tokenization.
                    Enumerated database fields usually translate well to Keyword fields in Zend_Search_Lucene.

                    <code>UnIndexed</code> fields are not searchable, but they are returned with search hits.  Database
                    timestamps, primary keys, file system paths, and other external identifiers are good
                    candidates for UnIndexed fields.

                    <code>Binary</code> fields are not tokenized or indexed, but are stored for retrieval with search hits.
                    They can be used to store any data encoded as a binary string, such as an image icon.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <code>Text</code> fields are stored, indexed, and tokenized. Text fields are appropriate for storing
                    information like subjects and titles that need to be searchable as well as returned with
                    search results.

                <para>
                    <code>UnStored</code> fields are tokenized and indexed, but not stored in the index. Large amounts of
                    text are best indexed using this type of field. Storing data creates a larger index on
                    disk, so if you need to search but not redisplay the data, use an UnStored field.
                    UnStored fields are practical when using a Zend_Search_Lucene index in
                    combination with a relational database. You can index large data fields with UnStored
                    fields for searching, and retrieve them from your relational database by using a separate
                    fields as an identifier.
