    <title>Sunrise and Sunset</title>

    <para>
        <code>Zend_Date</code> has also functions integrated for getting informations from the sun. Often it is 
        necessary to get the time for sunrise or sunset within a particulary day. This is quite easy with 
        <code>Zend_Date</code> as just the expected day has to be given and additionally location for which 
        the sunrise or sunset has to be calculated.
    </para>

    <para>
        As most people do not know the location of their city we have also spent a helper class which provides
        the location data for about 250 capital and other big cities around the whole world. Most people could
        use cities near themself as the difference for locations situated to each other can only be measured within 
        some seconds.
    </para>

    <para>
        For creating a listbox and choosing a special city the function <code>Zend_Date_Cities::getCityList</code>
        can be used. It returns the names of all avaiable predefined cities for the helper class.
    </para>

    <example>
        <title>Getting all avaiable cities</title>
<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once 'Zend/Date/Cities.php';

// Output the complete list of avaiable cities
print_r (Zend_Date_Cities::getCityList());
?>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
        The location itself can be received with the <code>Zend_Date_Cities::City()</code> function.
        It accepts the name of the city as returned by the <code>Zend_Date_Cities::getCityList()</code>
        function and optional as second parameter the horizon to set.
    </para>

    <para>
        There are 4 defined horizons which can be used with locations to receive the exact time of sunset and
        sunrise. The '<code>horizon</code>' parameter is always optional in all functions. If it is not set, the
        '<code>effective</code>' horizon is used.
    </para>

    <para>
        Of course also a self-defined location can be given and calculated with. Therefor a '<code>latitude</code>'
        and a '<code>longitude</code>' has to be given and optional the '<code>horizon</code>'.
    </para>

    <example>
        <title>Getting the location for a city</title>
<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once 'Zend/Date/Cities.php';

// Get the location for a defined city
// uses the effective horizon as no horizon is defined
print_r (Zend_Date_Cities::City('Vienna'));

// use the nautic horizon
print_r (Zend_Date_Cities::City('Vienna', 'nautic'));

// self definition of a location
$mylocation = array('latitude' => 41.5, 'longitude' => 13.2446);
?>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
        As now all needed data can be set the next is to create a <code>Zend_Date</code> object with the day where
        sunset or sunrise should be calculated. For the calculation there are 3 functions avaiable. It is possible
        to calculate sunset with '<code>getSunset()</code>', sunrise with '<code>getSunrise()</code>' and all avaiable
        informations related to the sun with '<code>getSunInfo()</code>'. After the calculation the <code>Zend_Date</code>
        object will be returned with the calculated time.
    </para>

    <example>
        <title>Calculating sun informations</title>
<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
require_once 'Zend/Date/Cities.php';

// Get the location for a defined city
$city = Zend_Date_Cities::City('Vienna');

// create a date object for the day for which the sun has to be calculated
$date = new Zend_Date('10.03.2007', Zend_Date::ISO_8601, 'de');

// calculate sunset
$sunset = $date->getSunset($city);
print $sunset->get(Zend_Date::ISO_8601);

// calculate all sun informations
$info = $date->getSunInfo($city);
foreach ($info as $sun) {
    print "\n" . $sun->get(Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
}
